Hi there!

I found your profile on LinkedIn and I'm very impressed with your work.
We're a fast-growing startup and need a talented developer ASAP.

Budget: $15,000 for complete project
Timeline: 3 months
Start: IMMEDIATELY

Can we jump on a quick call via Telegram? My handle is @mark_j_tech
Much easier to discuss details there rather than email.

Best,
Mark Johnson
CEO, TechStartup Solutions

Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. The project sounds interesting.
I prefer to keep communications via email for documentation purposes.

Could you provide:
1. Detailed project requirements
2. Your company portfolio
3. References from past contractors

Thanks,
[Contractor]

Hey,

We're moving fast here! No time for formal stuff.
Trust me, this is a legitimate company.

Look, we can move to 50% upfront - that's $7,500 in your pocket immediately!
But I need your bank details to wire the funds directly.

Actually, let's do this - I'll send you a check for $10,000.
You keep $7,500 and wire the remaining $2,500 to our overseas UI designer.
It's easier for tax purposes this way.

Please respond ASAP - we have other candidates lined up.

Mark
