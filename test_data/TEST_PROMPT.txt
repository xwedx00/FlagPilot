COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TEST PROMPT
================================

I'm a freelance developer and I need urgent help with a situation that's developed 
over the past week. This is complex and I need you to analyze everything thoroughly.

SITUATION SUMMARY:
------------------
I received a job offer from "TechStartup Solutions LLC" for a $15,000 web development 
project. The CEO, Mark Johnson, contacted me via LinkedIn and has been pushing to 
move communications to Telegram. He sent me a contract that I need to sign within 
24 hours.

Several concerning things have happened:
1. He's offering 50% upfront ($7,500) but wants to send a CHECK for $10,000
2. He wants me to wire $2,500 of that to their "overseas UI designer"
3. The contract has IP transferring immediately (not upon payment)
4. No late fees are mentioned
5. "Satisfaction review" can delay payment indefinitely
6. Company was registered only 3 months ago
7. No reviews or client history anywhere

MY CONCERNS:
------------
- Is this a scam? The check overpayment scheme sounds familiar
- If it IS legitimate, how should I protect myself?
- What specific contract terms should I demand changes to?
- How should I respond to his emails professionally?
- What's the best way to verify if this company is real?

I've attached:
- The contract (context_1_contract.txt)
- My research on the client (context_2_client_research.txt)  
- The full email thread (context_3_email_thread.txt)
- A similar case study for reference (context_4_past_case.txt)
- My personal profile and situation (context_5_contractor_profile.txt)

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
-------------------
1. Risk Assessment: On a scale of 1-10, how risky is this opportunity?

2. Contract Analysis: What are the top 5 problematic clauses and how should 
   they be rewritten?

3. Client Verification: What additional steps can I take to verify this 
   company's legitimacy?

4. Communication Strategy: Draft a professional response email that:
   - Doesn't burn bridges if legitimate
   - Protects me legally
   - Requests reasonable changes

5. Red Flag Detection: Compare this to known scam patterns - what matches?

6. Action Plan: Give me a step-by-step decision tree for how to proceed

7. Payment Protection: If I decide to proceed, what payment structure 
   would you recommend?

8. Legal Considerations: Should I involve a lawyer? When?

Please analyze all the context documents I've provided and give me comprehensive,
actionable advice. I need to respond to this client within 24 hours.

TIME SENSITIVITY: HIGH
FINANCIAL STAKES: $15,000 potential project vs risk of scam loss
EXPERIENCE LEVEL: 5 years freelancing
